# UNG-Capstone-Project
My senior research project at the University of North Georgia - An Analysis of SQL Injection and the Defenses Against Them
This project included the development of a vulnerable web application.
This web application represents an online marketplace where users can create an account, browse products, and add credit card information linked to their accounts.
The backend database used for the application is MySQL Server version 5.5.51-38.1.
The application features 3 different levels of security the user is able to choose from, each using different methods to defend against SQL injection attacks.
An SQL setup script, named 'Capstone Database Setup Script.txt', is also provided and was used throughout testing to reset the information stored in the databases (namely for when drop table injections were performed).
